Agile team perception on the impact of People factors affecting agile
team Productivity: A Case study of Geveo

Organization performance is a key factor which determines the success or
the failure of a company. For a software company, their success depends
on the success or the failure of software they develop. Successful
software development depends on the development team and its
performance. Therefore the survival and the growth of a software company
depend on the performances of its project teams. Project performance in
an agile environment depends on various factors. But team productivity
might be the most important and influential factor of project
performance. A productive team delivers more quality software in less
time; thus increasing project outcome. While high productivity can be a
significant source of competitive advantage, low productivity can lead
to unhappy customers and project failures.

Measuring software development productivity is also not simple and
straightforward. Software companies used to measure productivity by
simple means of outputs such as lines of code, function points and
feature count. But as software development relies on mental work,
knowledge and experience, traditional productivity measurement do not do
the justice.

Since the introduction of agile development methodologies such as Scrum,
Kanban and Extreme Programing (XP), it is hard to determine individual
productivity as they are team processes. But measurements like user
story points per sprint, unfixed defects per sprint, Lead time, Cycle
time and net promoters score are used in scrum and kanban projects to
get an idea about team productivity. Although these measurements give an
abstract idea about agile team performances, they do not provide an
in-depth analysis of team productivity.

Team productivity is influenced by many factors, such as project
factors, product factors, process factors and people factors. While
scope of the project, time and cost constraints, complexity, criticality
of the project, project size are considered as project factors, factors
such as product domain, product size, complexity, UI designs are
considered Product factors. Both these factors depend on clients’
requirements and software companies have no direct control over these
factors. When considering processes followed, many companies in the
industry now follows agile methodologies which have shorten the
development time by removing unnecessary management processes and
provides the ability to cope with frequent requirement changes in
dynamic environments. Agile methods such as Scrum are people focus and
team driven even though software development is rather a technical
discipline. Therefore it is important to asses and understands what
personal skills and people factors affects team productivity in an agile
environment.

People factors

Software is developed by people for people. People are at the core of
development of software; communicating, making decisions, designing,
implementing and deploying software. Therefore software development has
both technical and people aspects. According to Chagas\[1\], people
factors falls into three types. First one is individual factors such as
Skills, Experience, and Motivation. Second one is interpersonal skills
such as Cohesiveness and Communication and the third one is
organizational factors such as Leadership. People factors are
significant because software development require more mental work
involving knowledge, experience and team work. Therefore team members
should be skilled, cohesive and motivated. And team productivity depends
on the interaction and coordination between team members who come from
different backgrounds and personalities. The very first value in the
agile manifesto is to value individuals and interactions over processes
and tools. Agile requires more involvement of members and more
interaction within team. Therefore productivity of an agile team will
depends more on the members of the team.

Study

Therefore it is important to identify the people factors which affect
productivity in any organizations. Prioritizing and using these factors
effectively will increase teams’ productivity for the company. Therefore
I thought it’s important to identify what people factors significantly
affect agile team productivity and who else is better than Geveo team to
answer this dilemma.

Four factors that is Cohesiveness, Communication, Leadership and
Motivation were selected to consider in the study. Then a Questionnaire
was developed to collect information from Geveo staff who have
experience on working in agile teams. Following indicators were used to
form the questionnaire.

Collected data was analyzed and interpreted using a combination of few
statistical indicators as shown below.

**Results**

| Model         | Karl Pearson correlation coefficient (P) | Coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) | Significance |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Cohesiveness  | .403                                     | .162                                         | 98.9%        |
| Communication | .441                                     | .194                                         | 99.5%        |
| Motivation    | .380                                     | .144                                         | 98.3%        |
| Leadership    | .233                                     | .054                                         | 84%          |

Conclusions

All four considered people factors have shown positive relationship with
agile team productivity. Therefore Geveo staff think all four factors
have positive impact on agile team productivity. Cohesiveness,
Communication, Motivation have moderate positive relationship with over
95% significance while Leadership have a weak positive relationship and
not significant in 95% of confidence level. Also Based on the
Coefficient of determination, Communication has the highest effect on
agile team productivity, then Cohesiveness and finally Motivation.
Leadership has the lowest effect on agile team productivity and
relationship is also not significant. Therefore according to Geveo staff
Communication, Cohesiveness and Motivation have a greater impact on
agile team productivity rather than Leadership.
