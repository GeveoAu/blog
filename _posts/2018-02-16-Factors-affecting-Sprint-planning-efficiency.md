Evolvement of software projects happened gradually. Like all the other
technologies, software development and project management modified over
the time with the idea of reducing expenses and increasing quality.
Software development faced more dynamic and rapid changes in competitive
industry and this caused significant amount of difficulties such as
changes of customer desires, timing restrictions, budget difficulties,
communication issues, etc. came in to play. The word ‘Agile’ used to
describe flexible rules of project behaviour, focuses on human
interaction and iterative and incremental software development and the
Agile software development methodologies began to emerge. Scrum is one
Agile method that has been published as a formalized organisational
pattern for software development.

Sprint Planning is the most important event, which is use to plan the
work to be done in the next Sprint. The collaborative effort of the
entire Scrum Team creates the Sprint plan and Scrum Master ensures that
all the members understood the purpose. Planning is a complex task and
critical for success of any software project. Sprint planning efficiency
is to optimize resource usage and achieve minimal time or on time
delivery. Company always tries to increase its profits and reduce costs.
This is an essential challenge company need to achieve while fully
utilizing its limited resources. When considering the software product
business, this is mainly handle with planning and decision making for
future releases and reduce cost while gaining more experience.
Therefore, firm to be profitable and cost effective, needs to have
efficiency in Sprint planning.

Objective behind the Sprint planning is to select the right set of
requirements within the limitations and constraints and maximize the
value for customers. Success or failure of the project will depend on
how well team achieves this objective in each Sprint. During the
planning need to find the right balance between customer requirements
and resources available for development.

Efficient Sprint planning is compulsory in order to optimal resource
utilization in reduced delay in delivery time. If the plan is accurate
then there will be minimize work redundancy and reduce software defect
density without putting extra burden on team members. Even though there
is a standard Scrum specific planning in place, there are factors that
can make planning inefficient. There can be technical factors and
non-technical factors that can have negative influence over efficiency
of Sprint planning. Inefficient sprint planning can cause many direct
and indirect issues in the organisation.

Trust between customer and the team can degrade if team fails to deliver
what they promised. Future of project will be difficult with unhappy
customers and ultimately can lead to project failures. Since team gives
the estimated Sprint plan, team is responsible to complete the plan work
for the Sprint somehow. If sprint works under estimated team has to work
over time to cover extra work. Then due to overtime work, quality of the
product can be reduced, employees can be demotivated, due to the time
limitation it can create aggressive team environment and can lead to
conflicts among members. This can reduce team collaboration and leads to
poor teamwork. If these issues occur, it will be a cost for the company.
If organisation can reduce the inefficient sprint planning it will
reduce these cost and add more benefits to the Agile software
development process.

Creating a plan with the correct scope is vital otherwise resources will
be wasted during the Sprint. Proper understanding, communication,
selecting correct requirements, breakdown tasks, etc. need to be done
efficiently during the planning in order to reduce resource wastage
during the Sprint. Otherwise there will be delays and final outcome will
be affected. Quality of the product will be a collection of iteration
releases. If each iteration delivers quality output ultimate product
will be a high quality product. Quality of the iteration output will be
depending on the efficiency of the plan.

<img src="/img/Thusitha2.jpeg" width="248" height="237" />To find the
right balance among the triple constraints for the Sprint, efficient
Sprint planning is required. Plan should adhere to time, cost and scope
constraints and must be delivered on time within the cost while meeting
the agreed scope. Changes in any constraint will result deviation unless
Project Manager rebalances the effect of the change using other
remaining constraints.

Following table lists few of significant factors that can affect the
efficiency of planning and categorized under Technical and Sociocultural
factors.

| Technical Factors                              | Sociocultural Factors                              |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Requirement Volatility                         | Lack of team member involvement                    |
| Poor PBI estimates                             | Poor communication                                 |
| Quality of the Requirement information         | Lack of QA team involvement                        |
| Technical dependency                           | Team behaviour                                     |
| Non-functional requirement ignorance           | Product owner/Customer relationship                |
| Clarity of ‘Definition of Done’                | Lack of domain knowledge                           |
| Defects and changes of previous implementation | Ineffective meeting time, Disturbing meeting place |
| Inefficient set of PBI selection               | Inefficient Product Backlog preparation            |
| Incomplete testing                             | Individual preparation                             |
| Quality level expectation                      | Team Leadership                                    |

inefficient Sprint Planning

There are significant number of technical and non-technical factors that
influence on the efficiency of Sprint planning. Not all of the above
factors might affect in our context. Sprint plan is a small part of the
entire project plan, by achieving sub goals efficiently will help to
meet ultimate goal efficiently. Therefore, efficient Sprint planning is
significant for the success of the project.
