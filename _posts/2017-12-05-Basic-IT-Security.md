Today, we live in an online world. Everything is connected to everything
else. Communication is not just limited to living things. Today, most of
the communication seems to happen among devices! With concepts like IOT,
the Cloud and mushrooming of smart devices, the amount of data exchanged
among devices is incredible!

Each day, we hear of a new ‘smart’ device coming up. From smart phones
to smart clothes to smart toilets to smart fridges to smart homes,
whatever we come into contact seem to be smart!

Well, now we need to ask ourselves a question. Do we actually know what
a ‘smart device’ is? Its implications? In most cases, we will not have
the correct answers to these questions.

In very simple terms, a smart device is a device with an operating
system or OS, and the ability to connect to a network such as the
internet. This ability opens up a world of possibilities and
unfortunately, some of it to hackers as well!

When a device is able to communicate over a network, we need to know
that the device is reachable via the network as well. In other words,
hackers will be able to communicate with your device, and exploit its
smart features and get access to information you did not want to share.

Although hackers have exploited many vulnerabilities in the devices
themselves to get hold of information, in most cases the main culprit is
not the device itself, but rather the users of these smart devices. Most
of the time, we compromise the security of these devices by not
following simple security guidelines and a lack of common sense.

Following are a few tips to make us smarter when using smart devices!

1.  Protect your password

    -   Never share your password/s with anyone – passwords should not
        be shared even with those who are close to you. If the person
        you shared your password with is careless with it, you end up
        paying the price. In the even you really need to share a
        password, make sure to change it to a random password (you can
        generate one from the internet), and then change it back again
        once the requirement is over.

    -   Never have the default password.

    -   Never use the same password for everything.

    -   Change your password every 3 months.

    -   Do not use your phone number, names. Names of loved ones, names
        you are associated with, as your password.

2.  Don’t let em fish you!

    -   Never use your credentials to login to a site that is
        not secure.

    -   Always be aware of the URL that you are using your credentials.
        Use your credentials only on the official site.

    -   Never provide your credentials in order to get free data, access
        to free stuff etc. Most of the times, these are traps by
        phishers to steal your passwords.

    -   If you accidently enter your credentials in a suspicious site,
        make sure to immediately change your passwords and report
        the site.

    -   Educate yourself about what phishing is and how to protect
        yourself from it.

3.  Mind that cam and mic!

    -   Often smart devices come with cameras and microphones. If such
        device are hacked, hackers will be able to eavesdrop on your
        conversations and spy on you without you even knowing it! Creepy
        stuff right? So make sure your camera and microphone is blocked
        when not in use. You can do this simply by using duct tape and
        covering the camera and microphone with it.

    -   Even when you need to use these, make sure that you are aware of
        what information you are sending. You don’t want to accidently
        send our images or information that might compromise
        your privacy. As much as possible, try to point them away from
        giving too much information about your whereabouts.

4.  Wipe it clean!

    -   Data can be retrieved from memory even after it is deleted. The
        memory needs to wiped to avoid this.

    -   If you are giving your device for repairs, make sure to remove
        the memory.

    -   If the memory cannot be removed, make sure to wipe it. This can
        be done simply by creating a dummy file and then deleting it, or
        simply download a tool from the internet.

5.  Don’t get logged

    -   Key loggers are a very easy trap to walk in to. Avoid using
        public computers to browse your personnel accounts as much
        as possible.

    -   If you really need to use a public computer, use a
        temporary password.

    -   If this too is not possible, change your password as soon as you
        can after using a public computer.

6.  Use 2-step verification

    -   This is a good way to protect yourself, even in the event your
        password is compromised.

    -   Activate 2-step login/ verification wherever possible.

7.  Keep your systems up to date

    -   Make sure to install the latest updates to your OS and
        security patches.

8.  Don’t dig your own grave!

    -   Never install anything from suspicious sources.

    -   Only install software or apps from sources you trust.

    -   Make sure to be aware of what permissions the app requires
        before installing.

    -   Be aware of abnormal data usage after you install a new app
        or software.

9.  Prevention is better than cure!

    -   Last but definitely not the least, one of the most important
        things, install a good antivirus software.

    -   This is almost a requirement now a days to keep your data safe.
