After the metaverse popularity, web 3.0 or decentralized web is the newest trend in the internet world. Though there is no proper definition for web 3, we can simply consider it as a new era of the internet. 

The nascent days of the internet in the 1990s were web 1.0.  Those days the internet was mostly a bunch of static pages. web browsers load data and HTML pages from a server and render them inside the browser. There weren’t any logins, interactions, and more importantly no advertisements based on analyzed user data. With time flash, JavaScript like things were invented and many new features were introduced. However, during these days, users went to the internet to consume information. 

Next, we have web 2.0, From around 2004 -to until now is considered the era of web 2.0. During this time, the web evolved drastically. The major thing is the interactivity of web applications. In simple terms unlike web 1.0 not only we get information from websites, but web apps also get information from their users. As an example, if we viewed a post from Facebook or performed a Google search, these centralized companies started collecting data about us so that they could serve us better and more relevant content and that leads us to stay longer in their websites. As a result of that, they could make tons of money. Eventually, some companies package our personal data and sell it to Advertisers. In other terms, Web 2.0 is all about targeted advertising and the lack of privacy of its users. People compromise their privacy to cool and funny apps like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. In web 2.0 if two people logged into the same social media platform and can see two different newsfeeds because the page depended on who is viewing it. Newsfeed is made from the data that has been provided by you, like your reactions to posts, how many times you watched a video. But if you look at the ads they show you, those are based on the data that you didn’t know you gave them. For example, if you went to Pizza hut yesterday, they will show you pizza-related ads. If you search for some clothes on Google, you will start seeing ads about trousers on Facebook or Instagram. If you think about it, you can imagine how badly they have been spying on us. Feels so vulnerable right?

Web 3.0 is the next evolution of the internet and most of the time it will utilize blockchain technology and the tools of decentralization.  Basically, you won’t see client-server architecture, and everything will be based on a peer-to-peer network. All web applications will be running on decentralized nodes. As a User one of the major advantages that you will be having is you will own your data and more importantly you will know what is happening with your data. In web 3.0 experts says that we will reach the point of the internet where every company will be run by a decentralized group called DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), In other words, which means there are no CEOs or Presidents to impress While those who are with most tokens get to vote on how the company changes without limiting by a government or some family tradition. 

Another cool thing in web 3.0 is your digital identity is not 100% connected to your real-world identity. Which means you can view pages, download things, make purchases and any other activity on the internet without being traced to the real you.

As a summary, web 3.0 is in the next decade you may be able to buy something from Amazon using Metamask and pay with Ethereum or you may leave a like to one of your friend’s posts using one of your hidden wallets. The Important thing to remember is Web 3.0 is a huge concept that contains a bunch of little ideas, and it is not going to be a huge change all at once.
