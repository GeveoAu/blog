We will have to say goodbye to the iPhone in 10 years. Do you think so too?
 
 [iPhone](https://www.apple.com/iphone/) - The line of smartphones that we all know very well, some of us were willing to do anything to purchase one in the early days. One of the two largest smartphone platforms in the world, competing with Android phones. The era of the iPhone is coming to an end within this decade, with the advancement of AR and VR now.
 
The first generation of iPhones was introduced by Steve Jobs in [2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_(1st_generation)), and it has come a long way – up to [iPhone 13](https://www.apple.com/iphone-13/) in 2021 now. If one carefully studies the generational gap between each iPhone model, there was a clear difference between iPhone 4 and 5, then iPhone 5 and 6. The iPhone 7 and 8 had some slight physical differences and the iPhone X was a stunner- no home button, no fingerprint scanner at all!
 
Anyhow, starting from the iPhone 11, the generational gap has been sinking consistently now, we weren’t able to see many physical differences in the iPhone 12 and 13, except for the processor enhancements and technical enhancements which aren’t that much concerning to the average users worldwide. The significant camera improvements and the processing improvements were always the icings on the cake when it comes to the iPhone upgrades/ purchases around the world each year.
 
If we think from an analytical and economical perspective, there’s only a very slight chance for iPhones being pushed into the history books and replaced by [AR/VR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality) wearables before 2030. We thought that the mighty smartphones would kick the PC to the curb, right? It would be the same dance here. iPhones would exist after this decade too but in a more discreet way.
 
Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, has been hinting for a while that augmented reality is crucial to the [company's](https://www.apple.com/) future. He described this technology as "essential" to the company's future in an interview.
 
Despite the fact that everything leads to an [AR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality) future, one thing continues to irritate me as an iPhone user for around 5+ years. Unlike an iPhone, which can serve tens of millions of people easily, an AR headset appears to be limited. It's quite... troublesome. Users have reported the physical irritations they felt,  from using gadgets like the Oculus, Meta's Ray-Ban, Snap's Spectacles, and other technologies that put cameras on glasses to be used as wearables.
 
Surely, the iPhone will be replaced slowly, by more advanced communication tools on or before 2030, but the iPhone will not extinct anytime soon. It’s the most valuable child Apple has produced so far; they’ll take care of it for a little while for sure.
 
There are now more questions than answers. Do you believe Apple will replace the iPhone with an augmented reality wearable in the next ten years? Do you believe the iPhone will ever be phased out? Let us see your opinions too.
