Customer Relationship Management system (CRM) is an essential tool that
is used by most of the businesses to gain a competitive advantage. In
present customers have more than ever options to select the correct
business partner. Therefore it’s crucial to an organization to know
their customers from the very beginning. Hence CRM systems offer many
out of the box features to support the organization sales pipeline.

Following are the out of the box features provided by many CRM systems

-   Contact management

-   Lead management

-   Deals and Tasks

-   Campaign management

-   Email Tracking

-   Social media engagement

-   Reporting and predictions

Today there are several CRM vendors available and each differs from
extra features, the level of customizability and pricing. Among those
Microsoft Dynamics CRM is a market leader who is being in the business
since 2003. According to the Gartner Magic Quadrant Microsoft Dynamics
CRM remains in the “leader” quadrant for consecutive years which sounds
promising.

Quadrant. Taken from https://www.gartner.com)

The Gartner magic quadrant positions competing players in a specific
market. The quadrant has four main sections and they are as Challengers,
Leaders, Niche Players and Visionaries.

Microsoft has made several releases for Dynamics CRM during the past few
years.

-   MS Dynamics CRM 1.0 (2003)

-   MS Dynamics CRM 4.0 (2007) – This was the first version which
    supported multi tenancy

-   MS Dynamics CRM 2011 (2010)

-   MS Dynamics CRM 2013 (2013)

-   MS Dynamics CRM 2015 (2015)

-   MS Dynamics CRM 2016 (2016)

-   MS Dynamics 365

Here onwards the discussion will be deviated from Dynamics CRM to
Dynamics 365. At a glance the new Dynamics 365 and its licensing model
was not straightforward to me. That led me to research on Dynamics CRM
in Dynamics 365 and about their primary classification of Dynamics 365
Enterprise and Business edition.

Dynamics 365 is a combination of CRM and ERP solutions in a cloud
service, which introduces a modular approach to purchasing and using
business applications.

Why Dynamics 365?
-----------------

In the end of year 2016, Microsoft changed their plans to re-launch
their ERP (Dynamics AX and Dynamics NAV) and CRM applications. This
resulted in combining their ERP systems and the CRM system in to a one
package called “Dynamics 365”.

Dynamics 365 includes the Microsoft’s most powerful predictive
technologies which are Power BI and Cortana. For instance Power BI
suggests a sales person who works at a major furniture store to purchase
more wooden sofas in the upcoming sales quarter. The predictive Business
Intelligent helps him to discover more opportunities that he did not
realize. According to Gartner these functionalities are not the core
Sales force automation (SFA) features, but will be essential to CRM
product offerings in the near future.

More importantly everything is now under one roof as a single software
but in two different flavors based on your exact requirement. The
upcoming section in this document will discuss how customers will
benefit with this new classification.

Another useful feature to highlight is the integration of Office 365
into Dynamics 365 solution, meaning that users don’t have to leave
Dynamics in order to access such programs. The following diagram
illustrates how easy to switch those applications.

(Figure 2. Dynamics 365 Integration with Office 365)

There will be two editions or flavors of Dynamics 365 based on customer
requirements.

Enterprise Edition
------------------

This is optimized for large scale complex organizations which operates
at global space. This edition has two types of subscription licenses.

-   User SLs are assigned on a “named user” basis. So that each user
    requires a separate User Subscription license.

-   Device SLs are assigned to license a device.

Business Edition
----------------

Dynamics 365 for Business Edition is a simplified version of Dynamics
365 which is optimized for Small to Medium scale businesses which
contains 10-250 employees. This is highly focused for sales, service,
and marketing applications. It’s also less expensive.

    This is currently available to USA, Canada and UK. This is formally
    known as Dynamics NAV.

-   Dynamics 365 for Sales, Business Edition

    This edition is built on top of formally known Dynamics CRM online.
    However it is a cut down version of Dynamics CRM Sales for
    enterprise edition. The features that are included in this version
    is relevant to a small and medium scale enterprises. Following are
    the features that will be included in this version.

    -   Contact and Account Management

    -   Lead and Opportunity Management

    -   Track Activities (i.e. Emails) against Contacts, Accounts,
        Leads, Opportunities

    -   Manage Product Lists

        in-app Dashboards)

    -   Configurable Sales Stages

    Enterprise Edition. Moreover this has not yet been released.

How to select the correct choice?
---------------------------------

-   Look at the modules which you need or will need in future

> For instance if you think that you need Project Service or Field
> Service functionality in future it would be advisable to consider
> Dynamics 365 enterprise edition. More importantly if you are
> considering Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, it would be
> advisable to evaluate whether the business edition is too small or the
> enterprise edition is too complicate to your organization. You can do
> that by evaluating Dynamics NAV (Business edition) and Dynamics AX
> (Enterprise edition). Based on your evaluation you can decide which
> dynamics 365 edition suites you.

-   Customization capability

    It’s more natural to extend Dynamics 365 features by customizations
    and integrations. There will be certain limitations when extending
    Dynamics 365 Business edition. Moreover there is a limitation when
    adding Add-ons to Dynamics 365 business edition.

-   Company Size

    If your organization has 250+ employees, it would be recommended to
    go for Dynamics 365 enterprise edition.

-   Budget

    This will be the most critical factor when deciding the correct
    Dynamics 365 edition.

    As for the conclusion I believe that the Microsoft has properly
    aligned their enterprise software applications based on the scale of
    the organization. For instance I found that previous Dynamics CRM
    had several modules which are not used by most of the small-medium
    scale customers who I worked with. But still they had to pay for the
    whole package. The new Dynamics CRM which is now known as Dynamics
    365 for Sales is a smart and a cost effective solution to business
    edition users. Moreover the new Business edition will attract new
    customers in near future.
