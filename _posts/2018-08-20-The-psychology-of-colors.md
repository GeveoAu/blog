Color psychology is a well known but less explored branch of psychological study of how our brain perceives the influence of colors on our mood and behavior.  Our mind reacts in colors while we usually don’t understand it. The moment when our eyes see a color, they connect with our brain and it gives signals to the endocrine system releasing hormones responsible for the moods and emotions. Color psychology plays a huge impact on many industries like business, marketing and design.

Websites and apps can be easily use if the colors are correctly chosen. Colors can be used to highlight and separate different sections, functions and elements. Colors can be used to indicate the priority of a function by using attention grabbing colors to high priority functions and neutral colors to indicate lower priority functions. Also, colors are used to recommend the severity of a function. For an example in a system "delete" buttons can be highlight by using red color and “add” buttons can be highlight by using green or blue color.
