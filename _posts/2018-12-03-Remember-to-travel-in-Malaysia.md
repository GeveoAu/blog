   This blog is to highlight the key values of visiting Malaysia, rather than discussing the general information, which you can easily search over the internet throughout millions of resources. Frankly, I am not well-known enough to talk about the entire Malaysia, since I have visited only Kuala Lumpur & Penang island for several times. 
   
   Malaysia is situated in the midst of the Asia Pacific region, bordering to Thailand, Singapore & Myanmar. Malaysia enjoys a strategic location and a year-round tropical climate. With 13 states, three Federal Territories and a population that currently stands at more than 28 million, Malaysia combines the best of Asia and is well known for its diverse cultural landscape, which includes three of Asia’s oldest civilizations – Malay, Chinese and Indian – and the unique ethnic communities of Sabah and Sarawak. Malaysia is a cosmopolitan country.
         
   And also One of the world’s top holiday destinations, Malaysia is filled with a wide variety of unique attractions. Whatever your definition of a fulfilling holiday, Malaysia has all the necessary elements – pristine beaches and breathtaking islands, a rich tapestry of cultures and history, well-preserved heritage treasures, world-class modern facilities, a fascinating collection of flora and fauna, lush and well-maintained nature reserves, a delightful array of mouth-watering cuisine and a long list of shopping hotspots – Malaysia will leave you wanting for more. But do not just take our word for it.
   
   You go and discover the many wonders of Malaysia and peel the many layers of this fascinating country. Be prepared to be amazed experience, which I had in several times, because there is just so much more to Malaysia than meets the eye.
   
   I know many of you in Geveo, have already touched this wonderful paradise at least once in their life time. However, now my intension is to promote this country among the rest of the staff in Geveo, who has not yet planned to visit Malaysia. Up to now, I have travelled in Malaysia, nearly 8 times during past couple of years, as a tourist, which brings me an enjoyable & relax time.
     
  Based on my past experience, I have created a travel itinerary named “Kuala Lumpur in 7 days” , which suites for anyone, who is looking for to make a 7days complete tour in the Kuala Lumpur (mainly), without missing the valuable places which you should definitely visit. This itinerary would definitely help you to make a success tour in Kuala Lumpur.
  
   Few among you, may have already seen & referred this travel itinerary before, if you had contacted me, once you were planning your tour to Malaysia. So personally, I thought of adding this travel itinerary in the Geveo blog to public, which you can refer at any time before planning your visit to Malaysia in future. 
   
   This blog is mainly to help you to plan your trip schedule in Kuala Lumpur, and It was a difficult task for me to stick to 7days travel itinerary when writing this document, since there are thousands of places to visit. However, I chose the key places only to fit to 7days.
