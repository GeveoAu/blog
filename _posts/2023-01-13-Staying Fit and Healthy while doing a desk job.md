description: As we step into the new year, we all have a set of goals for 2023. I am sure that at least a half of us have “Stay healthy and fit” or “get into better shape” as a part of our new year’s resolution. But let’s face it, being a software engineer and working on a desk everyday doesn’t do any favors to your fitness goals and your ideal body shape that you are dreaming of. On the other hand, even you have set fitness goals and are totally motivated to make a change this year, getting yourself to go to the gym or to start an at home workout session is already more than half the battle. Staying consistent of your exercise routine is a whole other problem given our daily commitments. Besides, doing a workout few times a week for few minutes is hardly enough to balance out the amount of time you spend sitting at your desk.

#### **01.	Deskercise**

It is true that you are busy, and you have a lot to accomplish in your to-do list. But taking a few seconds to stretch while working can help you with the body aches that you are having at the end of the day and boost your energy level. It can help you with your mental health and improve productivity as well. Take a small break and do some stretches and you’ll be fine. You don’t even have to get up from your chair.

#### **02.	Drink lots of water**

Staying hydrated is key to maintain your health and to prevent headaches and stay focus while working. Besides it’s a good excuse to get up from your chair and refill your water bottle. It’s advisable to drink at least 2 liters of water per day. Drinking water also helps you to avoid overeating by keeping you full all the time. As a rule of thumb, whenever you feel you need a snack, first drink a glass of water and wait for few minutes. If you still feel hungry, then go ahead and have that snack. Remember, it’s the little things that makes the difference. Keep a reusable water bottle at your desk to keep you hydrated throughout the day.

#### **03.	Small changes in your daily routine**

Walking is one of the easiest and best exercises. You should walk at least 7000-8000 steps to be healthy and active. So, look for various ways you can take to increase the number of steps per day. If you find yourself using the elevator too often, take the stairs when you are not in a hurry. When you go to work or to the supermarket, try to park your car at the furthest point, so you are forced to walk across the parking lot. Take a walk while taking a phone call. By making these activities your habits, your daily steps count will increase without any additional effort.

If you have enough money, try investing in healthy equipment’s that motivates you to stay healthy.
